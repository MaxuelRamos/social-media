### More Details

**Users**

- Only alphanumeric characters can be used for username
- Maximum 14 characters for username
- Usernames should be unique values
- Do not build authentication
- Do not build CRUD for users (registration and sign-in will be handled by a different service, the user model should be part of your data modeling tho. You can seed the database with 4 users to help the reviewer demo your solution)
- When/if necessary to make your application function, you may hard-code the user. For example, you may need to do this to implement creating new posts.

**Posts**

Posts are the equivalent of Twitter's tweets. They are text-only, user-generated content. Users can write original posts and interact with other users' posts by reposting or quote-posting. For this project, you should implement all three — original posts, reposts, and quote-posting

- A user is not allowed to post more than 5 posts in one day (including reposts and quote posts)
- Posts can have a maximum of 777 characters
- Users cannot update or delete their posts
- Reposting: Users can repost other users' posts (like Twitter Retweet), limited to original posts and quote posts (not reposts)
- Quote-post: Users can repost other user's posts and leave a comment along with it (like Twitter Quote Tweet) limited to original and reposts (not quote-posts)
